Old Way Hardware design: Verilog
New way Hardware Design in Software Engineering: 
1. Use Chisel embedded with Scala Programming (OOD + Functional Programming)
2. FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Recursive Moving Average Example:  Input Number of Points, Weight, project, hardware libraries, Compiler (C, X86, ARM, RISCV, etc.), platform (Apple SoC, Qualcomm Processor, Intel/Altera FPGA, AMD/Xilinx, etc).
