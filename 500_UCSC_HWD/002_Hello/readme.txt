We discuss Hello Scala/Chisel.
Topics:
1. Setup: UCSC uses Almond Web Server to run Scala Language under the Jupyter Notebook. Here, we install the Stable Scala 2.12.11 and Jupyter Notebook in the Ubuntu OS. We keep the UCB configuration and dependencies.
2. Scala Language: Literals, Inference, Declaration, operation, etc.
3. Chisel Tool Flow: 
3.1 Input Scala, Scala Compiler, 
3.2 Input Chisel Library, Generator, Generate ASIC Verilog and FPGA Circuit  
3. Chisel Libraries: Chisel library is embedded under inside the Scala language.
4. Chisel Languages: Chisel Type, Chisel Operator, 
5. Build and Test Simple Chisel Module: Chisel Design and Generate Verilog. 
6. Chisel Backend Flow:
6.1 Scala Simulation, 
6.2 FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation of Register Transfer Level), Verilog Generator.
7. Chisel Test: Poke, Peek, Expect
