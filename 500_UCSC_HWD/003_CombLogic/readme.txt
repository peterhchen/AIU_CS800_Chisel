We discuss Chisel Combinational Logic.
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells
2. Import Chisel Library
3. Mux: select two-inputs for output
4. Scala Class: class, inheritance, parameters, instance, object, keyword val, function overloaded.
5. Mux with parameter width
6. Scala logic control: if/else.
7. Chisel frontend: Scala programming and Scala Compilation
8. Chisel backend: Run Chisel, Chisel Library, Generator, ASIC Verilog/FPGA Verilog, Simulation/Verification.
9. Scala/Software Reference and Chisel/Hardware Object
10. Chisel Wire: Connect the Chisel/Hardware Object together.
11. Chisel logic control: when/.otherwise/.elsewhen.
12. Chisel Last Connect/Example
13. Chisel Bitwidth Truncation
14. 2â€™complement: Implement with Scala and verified Hardware.
15. Sign Bit Extension: Implement with Scala Fill and Concatenation and verified Hardware.
