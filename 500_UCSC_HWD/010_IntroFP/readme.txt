We discus the Functional Programming in Scala/Chisel HDL.
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells.
2. Both Scala and Chisel HDL use Functional Programming instead of looping in traditional programming.
3. Anonymous Function: In functional programming, we do not need function name. 
4. In functional programming, we never use loop, instead, we use map, foreach, and zip to replace loop.
5.  _ is a placeholder for all given inputs.
6. We change the 008.Arbiter with four lines of loop into map, zip/foreach in online Functional Programming.
