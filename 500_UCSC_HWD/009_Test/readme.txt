We discuss how to write the Chisel Testbench.
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells.
2. Chisel use test() utility to write the testbench. Other test tools: Tread, Verilator, and Verilog Simulator.
3. Simple Test: Combinational Component, modelAdd, and Passthrough 
4. Queue Model Test case: 
4.1 Define a Queue Model for complete test/simulation. 
4.2 Short test for pass/fail for Queue Model
4.3 Long/Loop test for Queue Model
4.4 Manually Comparison for Queue Model
4.5 Automate Interaction for Queue Model
4.6 Fill/Drain with sequence of data for Queue Model
4.7 Random Test for Queue Model
5. Summary:
5.1 Make test by human 
5.2 Random test maybe good, maybe be not great
5.3 Verilog Assertion only good for static test, not for simulation.
