We discus the Functional Programming in map, foreach, and zip. New, we talk about the reduce and fold.
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells.
2. reduce and fold: fold has foldLeft and foldRight. fold is lower level than reduce.
3. Class Reducer: We change the for loop into map, zip with Index, foldLeft, foldRigh, reduce and get the same Verilog and simulation result.
4. Class One-Hot Priority Encoder: Use map, zip, reduce to replace the for loop.
5. Class XBar (Crossbar): It has unknown error in Verilog Generator, not ready yet.
