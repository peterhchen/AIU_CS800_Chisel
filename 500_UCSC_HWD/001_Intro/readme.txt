UCSC 228A: Agile Hardware Design with Chisel (Constructing Hardware in Scala Embedded Language)
Introduction:
Topics: 
1. Why Advanced Hardware Design? Mobile phone, Data center, IoT, Electrical Vehicle, AI, laptop, etc. 
2. Increase Performance/Reduce Cost in Hardware Design Cycle.
3. Hardware Design Cycle: Traditional Waterfall vs. Modern Agile
4. Open Source Design: RISCV 128 Open Source shareware
5. Hardware Generator: Generate/Reuse ASIC RTL  (Register transfer Level) Verilog and FPGA Verilog
6. Chisel combines Scala (OOP, Functional Programming) and Domain-Specific Language (ASIC/FPGA Verilog).
7. Lecture, Lab, Project
