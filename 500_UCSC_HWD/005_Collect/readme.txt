Scala Collection vs. Chisel Collection:
1. Scala collection library: Collections are containers. Those containers can be sequenced, linear sets of items like List, Tuple, Option, Map, etc.
2. Chisel collection library: Chisel collections (Vec, Mem) for hardware generation
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells
2. Scala: Seq(), Range loop,  for loop:
3. Delay N Cycles with for and val/var
4. Use for in Tester
5. Chisel Vec()
6. Vector Parameters in Port
7. ROM with VecInit()
8. Chisel Mem()
9. Register File: Implicit Port/Explicit Port
10. Parameterized Port
