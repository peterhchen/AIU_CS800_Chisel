We discus the Functional Programming in flatMap, filter, sum, pattern Match, and options.
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells.
2. map vs. flatMap: Map return list, flatMap return the flatten list and logic operation. 
3. Sieve function with filter and sum.
4. Functional Programming for Matrix Multiplication: map, foreach, two loop map, zip Index, tabulate, etc.
5. Pattern match in Scala: Class name, string, logic conditions, objects, etc. 
Note: Scala use match … case, Chisel uses switch … case (Similar to C/C++).
6. Scala Options.
