We discuss the one-hot encoding, priority encoders, arbiters (仲裁者), and crossbar. 
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells.
2. Implement One-Hot Encoder with AND Gates
3. Implement On-Hot Encoder with Muxes
4. Implement One-Hot Priority Encoding
5. Implement Arbiters: If we have multiple components contend (perform the simulation) at the same time, such as, core or memory want to write the cache at the same time, Output ports of a network switch.
6. Implement our arbiters with our defined modules and with Chisel Utilities, RRArbiter(), LockingRRArbiter(), etc.
7. Implement Crossbar components.
