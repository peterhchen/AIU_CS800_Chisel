Q: What is Scala Encapsulation?
Ans: Encapsulation are Scala Object-Oriented Programming  for data hiding and methods overloading in a Scala/Chisel class.
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells
2. Recursive in Scala/Chisel. 
3. Bundles (struct in C/C++) and Modules are two common Chisel Libraries. Bundles are in in Chisel IO. Modules are used in Chisel Inheritance.
4. Factor Methods are predefined design pattern. We look the Class Counter and Class Bundle Examples.
7. Scala/Chisel have Option with optional data type.
