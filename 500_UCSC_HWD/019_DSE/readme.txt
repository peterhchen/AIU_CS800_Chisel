We discuss DSE (Design Space Exploration) for Hardware Design.
Topics:
1. DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling): We can use Chisel for Verilog Simulation or Aladdin,/Gem5 Architectural Simulator (Chip Statistics) 
2. Static Power and Dynamic Power
3. DSE (Design Space Exploration): We can use Hypermapper from Stanford University or OpenTuner
4. PAT (Power, area, Tinming) Pareto Frontier of CPU/Memory/GPU
5. PT (Power, Area) Pareto Frontier of Core Design
