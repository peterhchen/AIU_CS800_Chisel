1. Chisel vs. Spade: 
1.1 Chisel is good for software algorithm developer to translate from software architecture into hardware. 
1.2 Spade is a tools contains compiler and waveform viewer. Spade translate the Spade Specification into Verilog codes. Spade has direct control signal, clock, pipeline, network layers (header and payload) architecture.
2. Spade Pipeline Specification
3. Spade Compilation
4. Spade Ethernet: Network Layer and Packet Header and payload
5. Spade State Machine: Spade Specification code vs. Verilog Code
6. Chisel, Spade, XLS difference: Chisel from Software to Hardware, Spade control lower level signals, Google XLS (Accelerated Lowe Level SYnthesis) for layout/physical design.
6. Spade Power Optimization: Static and Dynamic Power.
7. Spade Area, and Timing Optimization
