We discuss Chisel Sequential Circuits, Generate VCD Dump, GTKWave Waveform Viewer
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells
2. Counter by Scala Software: Reg(), RegInit(), RegNext(), RegEnable(), when, switch
3. Counter by Chisel Generate Verilog/Hardware: Synchronous clock edge.
4. Implement Raccoon State Machine with Chisel: ChiselEnum, state, and edge/action.
5. Write Testbench and Run Simulation.
6. Use Scala println () in Scala simulation and Chisel printf() during the hardware simulation.
7. Generate VCD dump for MyCounter 
8. GTKWave viewer to view VCD dump.
