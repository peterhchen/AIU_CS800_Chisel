We will use Chisel Library for Queue Design.
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells.
2. We implemented Queue Design (from version 0 to 6)
a. Queueing behavior
b. Parameterized data, number of entry, and pipe parameter.
c. Latency based on occupancy
d. Efficient of less bits shifting and logic
e. enqueue and dequeue in the same cycle and queue/full cycle.
f. Support non-power 2 capacity
g. We will improve the data Type from from UInt to arbitrary data type.
