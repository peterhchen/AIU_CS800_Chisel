We discuss Physical Design Optimization and Memory Design
Topics:
1. Setup: jupyter notebook, select scala, and run cells.
2. Build Hardware by Chisel/Verilog
3. Physical Design Optimization: PAT (Power, Area, Timing)
4. Waterfall vs. Agile Design methodology
5. Littleâ€™s Law: measure latency, throughput, and parallelism
6. Memory Optimization: Banking, Bursty Averaging, Pipeline, and Double Buffer.
