Scala/Chisel OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Topics:
1. Setup: Select Scala interpreter for Jupyter Notebook and run.
2. Scala OOP: a. Abstract classes, b. Traits, c. Objects, d. Companion Objects, e. Case Class
3. Scala Abstract Class/Example
4. Trait (特征) Class/Example: Trait is similar to abstract class but differences: a. trait class can inherit from multiple traits, b. trait class cannot have constructor parameters
5. Object/Example: Object is for constant value.
6. Companion Object/Example: A class and an object use the same name and defined in the same file.
7. Case Class: Case class is similar to a regular class, but with built-in features for modeling data and pattern matching, including automatic generation of equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and a companion object with an apply() and unapply() method. 
8. Inheritance in Chisel: Hardware function inherited from based class Module, All IOs inherited from based class Bundle, all Data Type  inherited from based class Data.
9. Gray Encode/Decoder Example: Code Inherited from Module. Will discussed more logic in later on exercise.
