We discuss how to implement the FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filter with combinational Logic and Sequential logic.
Topics:
1. Setup: Start the Jupyter Notebook, select the scalar interpreter, run Scala in Jupyter Notebook.
2. FIR (Finite Impulse Response) with 4-Coefficients
3. FIR 8-bit Specification
4. FIR Filter problem
5. FIR Filter Scala Solution
6. FIR Testbench with input x and coefficients: 0, 0, 0, 0 
7. FIR Testbench with input x and coefficients: 1, 1, 1, 1 
8. FIR Testbench with input x and coefficients: 1, 2, 3, 4 
9. FIR Generator and View Module with Visualize(): It is a preview. We will discuss more in 3.2 Generator Collections.
10. DSP Block Integration: It is a preview. We will discuss more details in SoC (Rocket Chip).
11. Test DSP Block: We will discuss more in SoC (Rocket Chip).
