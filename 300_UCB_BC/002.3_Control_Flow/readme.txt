1. Setup: Scala uses maven to configure chisel libraries inside the source folder.
2. Wire connect multiple times. The last wire connection over write the previous connection.
3. when, elsewhen, otherwise: All these 3-statements must all in the structure. If we do not have all 3-statements, we use if {…} else {…} structure instead in Scala.
4. Code Example using when, elsewhen, otherwise.
5. Implement Sorter Code Example using when, elsewhen, otherwise
6. Exercise 1 (Polynomial Circuit): Pass in select flag and use when, elsewhen, otherwise to do the polynomial computation.
7. Exercise (Finite State Machine): Implement the FSM (Finite State Machine) for the Life of Graduate Student according the Finite State Machine (idea, coffee, coding, pressure, writing paper, graduated).
