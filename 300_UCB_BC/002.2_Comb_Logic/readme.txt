We discuss how to implement the Combinational Logic with Scala.
Topics:
1. Setup: Setup Chisel Libraries.
2. Common Operators Description: Add, Subtract, Multiplication, Mux, and Concatenation.
3. Code 1: Cast incompatible data type into same data type.
4. Code 2: Add, Subtract, Multiplication.
5. Code 3: Get test harness simulation results with expect.
6. Code 4: Chisel call Mux (Multiplexer) and Cat (Concatenation)
7. Exercise 1: Implement Chisel, simulation test bench, and generate Verilog/FIRRTL for MAC (Multiple Accumulator) with input a, b, carry c, and output.
8. Exercise 2: Implement Chisel, simulation test bench, and generate Verilog/FIRRTL for Arbiter for input FIFO and two pipelines (pipe 1 and pipe 2).
9. Exercise 3: Implement Chisel, simulation test bench, and generate Verilog/FIRRTL for Parameterized Adder.
