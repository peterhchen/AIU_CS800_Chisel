We discuss how to implement the Register Control Flow with Scala.
Topics:
1. Setup: Start the Jupyter Notebook, select the scalar interpreter, run Scala in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Register: Register contains the clock for sequential logic synchronization. 
3. RegNext: Convenient function which helps programmer to figure bit width of register creation.
4. RegInit:  Use different syntax for both Chisel initialization and in Verilog initialization.
5. Register Control Flow: Same as Wire Control Flow.
6. Register Operation: Register Operators (+, -, etc) for Unsigned Integer and Signed Integer.
7. Reset and Multi-Clock
8. Multi-Clock Example: Chisel code/Generated Verilog for Reset and Multi-Clock.
9. Exercise 1: Problem and Solution of LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) 
10. Exercise 2: Problem and Solution of  Reset for Shift Register.
11. Wrap Up: We have finished both the Combinational and Sequential Logic. Next, we will combine them together for the design.
