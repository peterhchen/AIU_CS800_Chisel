We discuss Scala Collections and Chisel Generators. 
1. Scala Collections are important building blocks for dealing with situations like this.
2. Chisel Generators will frequently have to deal with variable numbers of objects, whether they are IOs, modules, or test vectors. 
3. We introduce Scala collections and how to use them with Chisel generators.
Topics:
1. Setup: Select scala 2.12.11 for Jupyter notebook and run.
2. Scala Collection and Verilog Generator
3. Write FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Golden Model
4. Write Test for FIR Filter: Take the previous working FIR Filter as golden.
5. Write Test for FIR Golden Model: Write new FIR Flexible Model.
6. Write Parameterized FIR Generator.
7. Write ManyElement Filter
8. Test Different size of FIR Filter
9. Test Big Tap Data 
10. Hardware Collection: Design with collection of hardware components 
11. Exercise (Problem and Solution): Write Model and Test for 32-bits RISC-V Processor
