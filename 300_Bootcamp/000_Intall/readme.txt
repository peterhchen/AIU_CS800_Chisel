Chisel (Constructing Hardware in Scala Embedded Language) is a tool for digital hardware design.
1. This Bootcamp shows how to use Chisel, a Berkeley hardware construction DSL written in Scala. 
2. This Bootcamp uses Scala and Chisel for hardware generators.
Topics:
1. Introduction: Why do we need Chisel (Constructing Hardware in Scala Language)? how to use Scala to write design/Test? How to use Chisel libraries?
2. Prerequisites: Verilog/VHDL, FPGA, Digital Design, Scala Programming,
3. Installation and download: Introduce the installation and chisel-bootcamp download.
4. Install SBT (Scala Build Tool): SBT is for Chisel running in batch mode  
5. Install Open JDK Java 8: Java 8 for chisel.
6. Install Docker: Docker hub keep the working version for Chisel-bootcamp. It prevents tool chain compilation error due to dependencies .
7. Install Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter provides the interpreter for code and document presentation.
8. Install Scala: Chisel use Scala
9. Install Graphviz for Scala Module viewer
10. Install scala inside the Jupyter notebook: install coursier, almond, use almond to scala into jupyter notebook. In jupyter notebook, select scala as the default interpreter.
11. Outline: chisel-bootcamp web site organization
12. Why do we need chisel? Chisel use modern programming language Scala, write chisel generators instead of Verilog instance, better hardware design.
